# ðŸ“Š SQL Subqueries Practice â€“ Employee Sales Analysis

This repository contains SQL subquery practice problems using an employeesales table. Each query is designed to help users understand how to apply subqueries in real-world business scenarios such as comparing sales figures across months, filtering by top performers, and using aggregate functions within subqueries.

The goal is to demonstrate how to:

Use scalar subqueries to compare with single values (e.g., max or average sales).

Use correlated subqueries to compare row-by-row across departments.

Use subqueries in IN and EXISTS clauses for filtering logic.

Apply subqueries with GROUP BY and HAVING for department-level analytics.

ðŸ§  Who Is This For?
Beginners learning SQL and subqueries.

Data analysts practicing SQL interview questions.

Anyone building foundational SQL querying skills.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Use any SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

Create the employeesales table.

Run each query and understand the logic behind the subquery.

Try modifying them or creating similar queries on your own dataset.
